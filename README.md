Mini Challenge 2 - Redo
In this challenge the user would enter two numbers, and the program must recognize them as numbers with value, and add the values together.

peer review - Marcel R. It worked ass intended, I liked the use of if else to choose paths with perimeters and how the while loop made use of the already existing "Y" string to set the breakout condition. Data types for the numbers could be redone to match Ie. all int or all long, but other than that a great and fun program!


INSTRUCTIONS
Before anything, open the code in VSCode and run/debug the code. This should lead to a new tab opening, labelled localhost. Copy and paste the URL from that new tab, into the Postman "GET" area. Then, add to the end of the URL like this: 
https://localhost:xxxx/MathStuffs/Adding/x/x
The xxxx should be the 4-digit number individual to your computer. Then you wil have /MathStuffs/Adding, and in the next two spaces I have labelled x, put a number of your choice. Then, hit send. Text should appear telling you the sum of the two numbers you put into the URL.
