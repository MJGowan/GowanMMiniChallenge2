Mini Challenge 2 - Redo
In this challenge the user would enter two numbers, and the program must recognize them as numbers with value, and add the values together.

peer review - Marcel R. It worked ass intended, I liked the use of if else to choose paths with perimeters and how the while loop made use of the already existing "Y" string to set the breakout condition. Data types for the numbers could be redone to match Ie. all int or all long, but other than that a great and fun program!
